&lt;h2 id=&#34;location&#34;&gt;Location&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was done as a research internship at &lt;a href=&#34;https://research.adobe.com/about-adobe-research/bigdata-experience-lab/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Big Data Experience Lab, Adobe Systems, Bangalore&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;em&gt;May &amp;lsquo;18 - Jul &amp;lsquo;18&lt;/em&gt;, the summer of my third year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the internship, I worked as a Research Intern, among a team of 3 members and in close coordination with multiple research members of technical staff at the company, to accomplish the above-mentioned project. A general area of interest was assigned, and a specific problem statement was chosen in that area after an extensive period of brainstorming. Having decided on a problem statement, methods were devised to come up with a feasible solution for the problem. Multiple NLP techniques such as scene graph parsing, coreference resolution, and others were utilised to understand text, along with learning multiple MLP networks for certain tasks involved in the solution pipeline. The augmented reality aspect of the project was realized by using the ARCore library provided by Google, in the Unity3D framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final solution pipeline included multiple methods leveraged from existing works and improved upon, as well as novel methods for scene augmentation and a MLP prediction model that were introduced for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these multiple techniques intelligently in a pipelined manner, a first-of-its-kind novel end-to-end interface was developed that allows easy authoring of augmented reality experiences from natural language input. An internal survey was conducted, which temporarily validated the genuinity of the interface, and conducting the final crowdsourced survey is work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was done as my first undergraduate research project under &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/medha.atre/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Prof. Medha Atre&lt;/a&gt;, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project aims to utilize the the emotional information present in any media to perform cross-modal media
retrieval efficiently. We present an implementation to extract this emotion from images as 2-dimensional
vectors, and propose two methods to bring this emotion vectors from different medias in the same space, one
being a statistical approach, and the other being a learning based approach. We also present a hypothesis,
which allows us to establish a ground truth for the cross modal mapping. We perform extensive analysis of
one of our proposals, and report the results obtained. We have also proposed and implemented a heuristic
to retrieve cross-modal results efficiently.
The details of our project can be found in the project report &lt;a href=&#34;https://amr4i.github.io/pdfs/cross_modal_media.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Language Independent Text-to-Emotion Classification</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;location&#34;&gt;Location&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was done as a industrial software internship at &lt;a href=&#34;https://hike.in/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hike Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi&lt;/a&gt;, during &lt;em&gt;May &amp;lsquo;17 - Jul &amp;lsquo;17&lt;/em&gt;, the summer of my second year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project aimed at developing a machine learning model to &lt;strong&gt;assign an emotion to any chat message provided as input&lt;/strong&gt;. This would allow quick sticker recommendations to be based not only the textual reference, but also take into account the emotional state of the user for that message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This task was accomplished by developing neural network models using the open source software library &lt;em&gt;tensorflow&lt;/em&gt; from Google. In order to get the highest accuracy, multiple models had to be developed, all based on different machine learning techniques including &lt;strong&gt;CNN&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;RNN&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;LSTM&lt;/strong&gt; networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The esteem of the model lies in the fact that it is a &lt;strong&gt;language independent&lt;/strong&gt; model, which when trained on enough texts from any language, should be able to successfully predict the most probable emotion of any text in that language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project also comprised of gathering the data required for training this model. For this purpose, a sub-project had to be developed that acted like a &lt;strong&gt;Language-Classifier&lt;/strong&gt;, which segregated the chat corpus into chats of the top 5 chat languages in the application, namely Hindi+English, Tamil, Marathi, Gujarati and Bengali, but can easily be extended to any number of languages as required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This segregation into the different chatting languages was required since the data needed for training had to be prepared by manual tagging of the messages to a particular emotion class out of a predefined set of classes. Notably, the model does not require any language classification of the input message, once it has been trained on this prepared data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crude conversation data was obtained from a corpus of anonymized &amp;ldquo;random&amp;rdquo; text chat sequences. Following this, the language-classifier was applied to get the texts from each language separated out. The classifier started with the sticker tags of the languages, processed them at multiple stages and performed a frequency analysis through a Confusion Matrix to get unique set of words for each language. Using these words, some texts were extracted from the corpus for each language. These texts were then used to get a better and more extensive list of unique common words through the same process. Now, using this final word list, another frequency based search on the conversations allowed extraction of texts uniquely belonging to each language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These texts then had to be properly â€œcleaned&amp;rdquo; so as to contain only relevant information. This was done using some basic python scripting followed by running the corpus through a &lt;strong&gt;Vector Space Model&lt;/strong&gt; (VSM) that used word2Vec modelling and tf-idf weights to generate word and document vectors, and use those to clear irrelevant and repeated information. The process also involved gathering data from multiple NoSQL databases in MongoDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a &lt;strong&gt;Server-Client support&lt;/strong&gt; for the model was also developed wherein the user could submit the text, which is processed by the Client and submitted to the Server along the necessary details as a GRPC request. The server hosts the multiple versions of the model, with the latest being fetched to answer the query it receives from the client. This support was added through Google&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;tensorflow_serving&lt;/em&gt; library. The model can also be hosted on Google Machine Learning Engine, the support for which can be easily implemented in the existing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tensorflow serving library has support only on linux environments, and hence for setting up the server system, a appropriate &lt;strong&gt;Docker&lt;/strong&gt; environment also had to be set-up on the local machine, that included all the dependencies for the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a simple but efficient extension, the text message that contains emojis isn&amp;rsquo;t analyzed via the model, and instead the emotion can be directly taken from the emoji itself on the client itself without any need to hit the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;location&#34;&gt;Location&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was done as a remote software development internship at &lt;a href=&#34;https://nyc.iitk.ac.in/NYC/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;New York Office, IIT Kanpur&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;em&gt;May &amp;lsquo;18 - Jul &amp;lsquo;18&lt;/em&gt;, the summer of my second year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project comprised of completing multiple tasks within the assigned duration of the internship.
The first task was to implement the &lt;strong&gt;Document Distance&lt;/strong&gt; problem, to remove the semantically same articles from large collection of articles. This was accomplished by using word vectors and document vectors and implementing the &lt;strong&gt;Word Moverâ€™s Distance&lt;/strong&gt; algorithm to successfully eliminate all similar entries within acceptable error values. We also experimented with word-vectors and tf-idf weights to generate document vectors and finding semantically similar articles through cosine similarity of these document vectors, but Word Moverâ€™s distance was the final method used because of better accuracy, though being slower than the other approach. The development was done in Python, and used both pre-trained word embeddings and custom trained word embeddings to get a requirement specific model.&lt;br /&gt;
The second task was to implement the &lt;strong&gt;Reverse k-Nearest Neighbour&lt;/strong&gt; problem. The data would contain two sets of coordinates, one for facilities and the other for users. The task is to return all those users (BiChromatic RkNN) or facilities(MonoChromatic RkNN) for which the query facility is among the k-Nearest facility. This task required proper data structure that could allow quick access and insertion along with efficient spatial storage, as we need to work with 2D coordinates. Hence, two separate R-Trees were used to store the coordinates of users and facilities. Then the &lt;strong&gt;SLICE&lt;/strong&gt; algorithm was used to implement RkNN problem, that partitions the space in equal sectors around the query, and acts as an improved version of halfSpace and Six-region algorithms combined to get pruning and verification done relatively faster in speed and I/O operations combined. The code for this problem was implemented in C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was done as part of the course &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/pages/CS671.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CS671: Introduction to Natural Language Processing&lt;/a&gt;, in the Spring &amp;lsquo;18 term at IIT Kanpur under &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.iitk.ac.in/new/dr-harish-karnick#&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Prof. Harish Karnick&lt;/a&gt;, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much work has been done on Neural Machine Translation, but most of it requires
the availability of a large parallel corpora to train on, which is not always readily
available. Unsupervised methods also exist that work by encoding both the languages
in consideration to a common latent space, and then decoding them to the
target language as required. This work aims at an accurate implementation of the
work presented in Lample et al. (2017), and train it on a non-parallel corpora of
English and Catalan languages. Baseline implementation is evaluated using BLEU
score metric. We also hypothesize that adding the GCN layers would optimize the
existing representations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of our project can be found in the project report &lt;a href=&#34;https://amr4i.github.io/pdfs/neural_machine_translation.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was started as part of the course &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/pages/CS771.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CS657: Information Retrieval&lt;/a&gt;, in the Spring &amp;lsquo;18 term at IIT Kanpur under &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/arnabb/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya&lt;/a&gt;, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur. It has been continued beyond the course into my second undergraduate research project, and is still in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, we introduced a novel pipeline to implement a query-biased multi-document
abstractive summarisation. Traditional information retrieval systems return a ranked
list of whole documents as the answer to a query. However, in many cases, not every part
of an entire document is relevant to the query. Thus, it is desirable to retrieve from
the set of retrieved documents, in a succinct manner, a summary of only the required
information extracted from across all the relevant documents. The approach proposed
involves retrieving relevant documents for each query, followed by extracting relevant
passages from each document. This is followed by collating all such relevant passages
and performing redundancy removal to keep the length of such a collated document sane.
Finally, an abstractive summarisation approach is used to generate abstractive single-line
summaries for our information need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of our project, as of now, can be found in the project report &lt;a href=&#34;https://amr4i.github.io/pdfs/query_abs_summary.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;details&#34;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project was done as part of the course &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/pages/CS771.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CS771: Machine Learning Techniques&lt;/a&gt;, in the Fall &amp;lsquo;17 term at IIT Kanpur under &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/purushot/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Prof. Purushottam Kar&lt;/a&gt;, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of reviewer assignment to the papers of a conference is a very challenging and sensitive
task. The choice of reviewers for a particular paper plays a crucial role in determining whether
the paper is accepted into the conference. Automating the task of choosing reviewers is one of the
recent challenges being actively researched by the machine learning community. The state of the
art paper-matching system is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/documents/tpms.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Toronto Paper Matching System&lt;/a&gt; which uses an LDA based topic
modelling approach to identify topics in the entire paper and a simple dot product to assess similarity
between reviewer topics and paper topics. Our approach builds on this line of work and develops
an alternating optimization approach for completing the matrix of relevance scores between paper
vectors and author vectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did an extensive survey of the feild and understood the currently most prevalent techniques for automated paper-reviewer assignment like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/documents/tpms.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Toronto Paper Matching System&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://engineering.nyu.edu/~suel/papers/reviewer.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Robust Paper-Reviewer Assignment Model&lt;/a&gt;. We implemented multiple modifications and techniques for improving the TPMS system by improvising on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation technique used in the generative model, and adding some intuitive biases.
We also implemented an alternating optimization approach for completing the matrix of relevance scores between
paper vectors and author vectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of our project can be found in the project report &lt;a href=&#34;https://amr4i.github.io/pdfs/reviewer_recommendation.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

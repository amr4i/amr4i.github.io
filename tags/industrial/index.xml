      <description>Location This project was done as a research internship at Big Data Experience Lab, Adobe Systems, Bangalore during May &amp;lsquo;18 - Jul &amp;lsquo;18, the summer of my third year.
Details During the internship, I worked as a Research Intern, among a team of 3 members and in close coordination with multiple research members of technical staff at the company, to accomplish the above-mentioned project. A general area of interest was assigned, and a specific problem statement was chosen in that area after an extensive period of brainstorming.</description>

      <description>Location This project was done as a remote software development internship at New York Office, IIT Kanpur during May &amp;lsquo;18 - Jul &amp;lsquo;18, the summer of my second year.
Details The project comprised of completing multiple tasks within the assigned duration of the internship. The first task was to implement the Document Distance problem, to remove the semantically same articles from large collection of articles. This was accomplished by using word vectors and document vectors and implementing the Word Moverâ€™s Distance algorithm to successfully eliminate all similar entries within acceptable error values.</description>

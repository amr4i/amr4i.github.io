      <description>Location This project was done as a research internship at Big Data Experience Lab, Adobe Systems, Bangalore during May &amp;lsquo;18 - Jul &amp;lsquo;18, the summer of my third year.
Details During the internship, I worked as a Research Intern, among a team of 3 members and in close coordination with multiple research members of technical staff at the company, to accomplish the above-mentioned project. A general area of interest was assigned, and a specific problem statement was chosen in that area after an extensive period of brainstorming.</description>
